Fakebook: A Social Media Mockup

Overview

Fakebook is an iOS application that simulates a simple social media platform. It allows users to view a list of mock posts from the network, save their favorite posts, and view post details along with a list of comments. The application is designed with a focus on user experience, featuring a modern and responsive design, with full offline functionality support.

Key Features

Main Tabs

Posts Tab:

Displays a list of posts fetched from JSONPlaceholder API.

The list remains available even if there is no internet connection.

Notifies the user if the internet connection is unavailable.

Clicking on a post opens a detail screen that displays the post details and its associated comments.

A button to add/remove the post from the favorites list.

Favorites Tab:

Displays a list of all posts that have been added to favorites.

If a post is favorited while offline, it syncs with the server automatically once the internet connection is restored.

A local notification is sent to inform the user when synchronization is completed.

Additional Features

Full Offline Support:

Ability to save favorite posts locally using Core Data.

Automatic synchronization of favorite posts with the server when back online.

Responsive Design:

Supports all screen sizes and iOS devices.

Dynamic cell height to ensure all content is displayed without truncation.

Testing & Notifications:

Unit testing ensures code quality.

UI testing guarantees a smooth user experience.

Local notifications inform users about internet connection status and data synchronization.

Custom Design & Architecture:

Custom fonts and design extensions for a unique user experience.

Implemented using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

Utilized Singletons and Dependency Injection for better scalability and maintainability.
